# RusticUI changelog

RusticUI documents every step of the transition from Material UI for Rust to the Apotheon.ai–stewarded RusticUI platform. The
archived Material UI change history now lives in [`docs/archives/material-ui-changelog.md`](docs/archives/material-ui-changelog.md).

## 2025-03-04 – Reintroducing RusticUI

### Highlights

- Rebranded the public documentation to RusticUI and Apotheon.ai stewardship.
- Archived legacy Material UI guidance under `docs/archives/` for historical access.
- Established translation, demo scaffolding, and theming guidance aligned with the new automation-first workflow.

### Backlog

- [ ] Publish crates under the `rustic-ui-*` namespace and update all imports accordingly.
- [ ] Replace Material icon assets with the Rustic iconography pipeline.
- [ ] Produce end-to-end migration guides for Leptos, Yew, Dioxus, and Sycamore consumers.
- [ ] Stand up nightly accessibility and visual regression suites tailored to RusticUI branding.
