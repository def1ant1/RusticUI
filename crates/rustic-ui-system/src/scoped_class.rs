//! Scoped class utilities shared by the framework adapters.
//!
//! The system components used to concatenate inline style strings and bolt them
//! directly onto DOM nodes. While convenient, that approach prevented us from
//! reusing Material UI's styling engine which expects CSS rules to be registered
//! globally and referenced via deterministic class names.  This module provides
//! a small wrapper around the [`Style`] handle returned by
//! [`css_with_theme!`](rustic_ui_styled_engine::css_with_theme) so adapters can convert
//! raw CSS declarations into a class while keeping the underlying style alive
//! for as long as the component is mounted.
//!
//! By funnelling the registration logic through a dedicated type we avoid
//! copyâ€‘pasting the same macro invocation across every adapter, document how the
//! theme is retrieved and guarantee that future integrations (for example
//! Sycamore or Dioxus) can lean on the exact same lifecycle.  The struct also
//! exposes accessors for the generated class name and stylesheet which keeps our
//! integration tests and documentation snippets straightforward.
