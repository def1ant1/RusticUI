//! Core styling primitives for Material UI in Rust.
//!
//! This crate provides the building blocks used by higher level Material
//! components. At the moment it's just a placeholder, but the documentation
//! outlines the intent so contributors know where to add new abstractions.

/// A no-op function proving the crate compiles. Real functionality will be
/// added as the project evolves.
