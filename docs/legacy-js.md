# Legacy JavaScript Guidance

Material UI began as a React and TypeScript project. The JavaScript implementation and associated documentation now live in the primary [mui/material-ui](https://github.com/mui/material-ui) repository and on [mui.com](https://mui.com/).

This file exists as an archive for teams still maintaining JS code. New projects should prefer the Rust crates described in the root README.
