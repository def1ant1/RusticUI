# Introduction

Welcome to the **MUI Rust Guide**.  This `mdBook` offers Rust-first guidance on
building user interfaces with the `mui-*` crates.  The content is designed to be
automatically generated and kept in sync with the code base.

```bash
# Build the book and open it locally
mdbook build docs/rust-book && xdg-open docs/rust-book/book/index.html
```

The book complements the API documentation produced by `cargo doc` and is
published alongside it from continuous integration.
