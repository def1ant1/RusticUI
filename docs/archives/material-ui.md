# Material UI archive

The RusticUI project originated from the Material UI for Rust experiment. All historical JavaScript-specific assets are preserved
here for reference while the Rust codebase evolves under the Apotheon.ai stewardship.

- Legacy repository: <https://github.com/mui/material-ui>
- Historical documentation: <https://mui.com/>
- Migration notes: see [`CHANGELOG.md`](../../CHANGELOG.md) for the backlog of Rust-specific milestones.

No active development happens in this archive and issues filed against the Material UI stack should be opened in the upstream
project. RusticUI contributors keep these links available to unblock teams completing their final migrations.
