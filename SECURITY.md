# Security policy

## Supported versions

RusticUI follows Apotheon.ai's release train. Stable channels receive security updates for 18 months while long-term support (LTS)
channels remain patched for 30 months. Versions older than that window should migrate to the latest release train.

| RusticUI version | Release date | Status                  |
| ----------------:| :----------- | :---------------------- |
|          ^0.2.0* | 2025-06-??   | :white_check_mark: Planned stable |
|          ^0.1.0  | 2025-03-04   | :white_check_mark: Active preview |
|          <0.1.0  | /            | :x: Unsupported         |

`^0.2.0*` denotes the first stable RusticUI release after the rebranding. Dates will be updated once the milestone ships.
