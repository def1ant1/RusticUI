# RusticUI Select Menu â€” Leptos

The Leptos example mirrors the Yew implementation to show how the shared
`select-menu-shared` crate enables consistent rendering, automation hooks, and
SSR behaviour across frameworks. State is stored in `RwSignal`s so Leptos can
reactively control the headless `SelectState` and keep hydration in sync with
the server snapshot.

## Prerequisites

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo install trunk
```

## Client-side development

```bash
cd examples/select-menu-leptos
trunk serve --open
```

The component spins up immediately with a fallback message, then updates once
the async loader resolves. Toggle buttons demonstrate how controlled props can
be wired into existing signals without bypassing the shared render helpers.

## Server-side rendering smoke test

```bash
cargo run --manifest-path examples/select-menu-leptos/Cargo.toml --no-default-features --features ssr > ssr.html
```

The generated HTML is the exact markup consumed by the CSR build. Automation
ids and ARIA attributes are identical across server and client passes to keep
end-to-end tests stable.
