# Navigation Drawer with Leptos

A routing-aware Leptos implementation of the responsive Material drawer. The
example focuses on exposing accessibility attributes, responsive anchor
switching and centralized automation hooks.

## Usage

```bash
./examples/navigation-drawer-leptos/scripts/bootstrap.sh
cat target/navigation-drawer-leptos-demo/README.md
```

## Highlights

- Responsive anchor switching via `DrawerLayoutOptions`.
- Controlled vs uncontrolled state toggles implemented through `DrawerState`.
- Accessibility metadata retained across SSR/CSR environments.
