# Navigation Tabs with Sycamore

Sycamore consumes the same markup generated by `rustic_ui_material`'s tab adapters.
The blueprint relies on `sycamore-router` for navigation and uses the
server-friendly render helpers to keep markup identical across frameworks.

## Automation

The script below prints a step-by-step recipe and deposits commented code
snippets under `target/navigation-tabs-sycamore-demo/` for quick prototyping.

```bash
./examples/navigation-tabs-sycamore/scripts/bootstrap.sh
```
